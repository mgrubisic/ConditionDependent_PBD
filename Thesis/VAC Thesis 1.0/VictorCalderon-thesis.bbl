    The NGA-West2 project database expands on its predecessor to include
  worldwide ground motion data recorded from shallow crustal earthquakes in
  active tectonic regimes post-2000 and a set of small-to-moderate-magnitude
  earthquakes in California between 1998 and 2011. The database includes 21,336
  (mostly) three-component records from 599 events. The parameter space covered
  by the database is M 3.0 to M 7.9, closest distance of 0.05 to 1,533 km, and
  site time-averaged shear-wave velocity in the top 30 m of V S30 ¼ 94 m∕s
  to 2;100 m∕s (although data becomes sparse for distances {\textgreater}400
  km and V S30 {\textgreater} 1;200 m∕s or {\textless}150 m∕s). The
  database includes uniformly processed time series and response spectral
  ordinates for 111 periods ranging from 0.01 s to 20 s at 11 damping ratios.
  Ground motions and metadata for source, path, and site conditions were
  subject to quality checks by ground motion prediction equation developers and
  topical working groups.%

    The sustained development of computational power continues to promote the
  use of distributed inelasticity fiber frame models. The current article
  presents a comprehensive application and discussion of state-of-the-art
  formulations for the nonlinear material response of reinforced concrete
  structures. The broad character of the study is imparted by the joint
  analysis of the effects of the type of formulation (displacement based versus
  force based), sectional constitutive behavior (hardening versus softening
  response), and numerical integration parameters (such as quadrature method,
  mesh definition, or number of integration points). Global and local responses
  are assessed, along with a critical review of existing regularization
  techniques. An experimentally tested cantilever is used to conduct the study
  and illustrate the previous features. The example shows that the convergence
  of displacement-based meshes under objective response can be much slower than
  what preceding studies indicate, unlike their force-based counterpart.
  Additionally, the physical interpretation of the local response under
  softening behavior supports the proposal of a novel regularization scheme for
  displacement-based elements, validated through comparison against
  experimental results.%

  codes in many countries. In particular, it has been used extensively for the

  The 1990 Model Code provides comprehensive guidance to the scientific and

    Electrochemical measurements of chloride thresholds are reported in
  simulated concrete pore solution for as-received and surface-modified rebar
  in an experimental apparatus designed to simulate service conditions. Surface
  modification led to higher chloride thresholds and reduced variability. The
  variability in thresholds for as-received rebar was represented by a
  log-normal distribution; therefore, simple averages of chloride thresholds,
  without reference to underlying distribution, might not provide reliable
  indicators of depassivation. The relative constancy of electrochemical
  measurements below thresholds, and the dependence of the thresholds on
  surface conditions, suggests that rebar depassivation is likely caused by
  local critical chemical conditions at the steel surface. {\textcopyright}

    This paper presents the formulation of a time-dependent seismic fragility
  format for bridges, as well as new insights into the potential effects of
  aging and deterioration on seismic vulnerability traditionally neglected in
  fragility modeling, including joint impacts of multiple component
  deterioration not investigated to date. The study evaluates the impact of
  lifetime exposure to chlorides from deicing salts on the seismic performance
  of multispan continuous highway bridges, considering corrosion of reinforced
  concrete columns and steel bridge bearings. The components' degradation and
  their influence on seismic response are illustrated through three-dimensional
  nonlinear dynamic analysis. A full probabilistic analysis accounting for
  variation in bridge, ground motion, and corrosion parameters is conducted to
  develop time-dependent seismic fragility curves. These fragility curves
  indicate the evolving potential for component and system damage under seismic
  loading considering time-dependent corrosion-induced deterioration. The
  results indicate that while corrosion may actually decrease the seismic
  vulnerability of some components, most critical components suffer an increase
  in vulnerability. Quadratic models depicting the change in lognormal seismic
  fragility parameters are proposed to capture the time-dependent effect of
  aging on the fragility of the bridge system. Overall, the seismic
  vulnerability significantly increases throughout the lifetime of the
  representative bridge geometry, with a 32{\%} shift in the median value of
  complete damage fragility near the end of the bridge's life.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Civil infrastructures, such as highway bridges, located in seismically
  active regions are often subjected to multiple earthquakes, including
  multiple main shocks during their service life or main shock–aftershock
  sequences. Repeated seismic events result in reduced structural capacity and
  may lead to bridge col- lapse, causing disruption in the normal functioning
  of transportation networks. This study proposes a framework to predict damage
  accumulation in structures subjected to multiple shock scenarios after
  developing damage index prediction models and accounting for the
  probabilistic nature of the hazard. The versatility of the proposed framework
  is demonstrated on a case-study highway bridge located in California for two
  distinct hazard scenarios: (1) multiple main shocks during the service life
  and (2) multiple aftershock earthquake occurrences follow- ing a single main
  shock. Results reveal that in both cases there is a significant increase in
  damage index exceedance probabilities due to repeated shocks within the time
  window of interest.%

  standardized laboratory reversed cyclic loading and re-creations of the
  displacement responses obtained from a nonlinear time-history analysis of
  multiple earthquakes with distinct characteristics. Longitudinal reinforcing
  bars were instrumented to obtain strain hysteresis, vertical strain profiles,
  cross section curvatures, curvature distributions, and fixed-end rotations
  attributable to strain penetration. Results have shown that the limit state
  of reinforcement bar buckling was influenced by load history, but the
  relationship between strain and displacement along the envelope curve was
  not. The main impact of load history on bar buckling is its influence on
  accumulated strains within the longitudinal reinforcement and transverse
  steel.%

    This paper presents the results of an investigation on degradation of
  seismic performance of reinforced concrete (RC) columns damaged by
  reinforcement corrosion. A total of 13 reinforced concrete circular columns
  were tested under combined cyclic lateral displacement excursions and
  constant axial load after being subjected to accelerated corrosion tests. The
  controlled variables in the test were corrosion level and axial load ratio.
  The steel corrosion loss ratios ranged from 0{\%} to 15.1{\%}, and the axial
  load ratios varied from 0.15 to 0.9. Based on the test results, degradation
  models for loading capacity, stiffness, ductility and energy dissipation
  capacity of columns were proposed. Test results show that higher corrosion
  levels and higher axial loads result in less stable hysteretic loops with
  more severe strength and stiffness degradations and worse ductility, and that
  the energy dissipation of corroded specimens at the same displacement
  excursions is approximately the same as that of control specimens, regardless
  of the corrosion level, when the rebar corrosion loss ratio is less than
  14{\%}.%

    Recent efforts in the earthquake engineering community have focused largely
  on developing a performancebased earthquake engineering assessment
  methodology. However, equally important is applying such a methodology to the
  design of structures. Probabilistic performance-based seismic design enables
  design and acceptance criteria to be specified by a continuum of limit states
  and incorporates uncertainty in all the sources of data. This paper
  introduces a non-iterative method, based on the Pacific Earthquake
  Engineering Research Center framework, for design of bridge structures in
  terms of single or multiple physical design parameters, such as column height
  and diameter. Design parameter solutions are obtained from explicit
  consideration of uncertainty in the hazard, demand, damage, and loss to the
  structure by way of specifying a level of confidence in the resulting design
  under different performance objectives. Similar to other performance-based
  methodologies, performance objectives consist of a performance level and a
  hazard level. Design equations are derived for performance levels defined in
  terms of bridge damage and loss. Examples are presented of both univariate
  and bivariate design parameter cases for typical reinforced concrete highway
  overpass bridges in California.%

    A stress‐strain model is developed for concrete subjected to uniaxial
  compressive loading and confined by transverse reinforcement. The concrete
  section may contain any general type of confining steel: either spiral or
  circular hoops; or rectangular hoops with or without supplementary cross
  ties. These cross ties can have either equal or unequal confining stresses
  along each of the transverse axes. A single equation is used for the
  stress‐strain equation. The model allows for cyclic loading and includes
  the effect of strain rate. The influence of various types of confinement is
  taken into account by defining an effective lateral confining stress, which
  is dependent on the configuration of the transverse and longitudinal
  reinforcement. An energy balance approach is used to predict the longitudinal
  compressive strain in the concrete corresponding to first fracture of the
  transverse reinforcement by equating the strain energy capacity of the
  transverse reinforcement to the strain energy stored in the concrete as a
  result of the confinement.%

    Object composition offers significant advantages over class inheritance to
  develop a flexible software architecture for finite-element analysis. Using
  this approach, separate classes encapsulate fundamental finite-element
  algorithms and interoperate to form and solve the governing nonlinear
  equations. Communication between objects in the analysis composition is
  established using software design patterns. Root-finding algorithms, time
  integration methods, constraint handlers, linear equation solvers, and degree
  of freedom numberers are implemented as interchangeable components using the
  Strategy pattern. The Bridge and Factory Method patterns allow objects of the
  finite-element model to vary independently from objects that implement the
  numerical solution procedures. The Adapter and Iterator patterns permit
  equations to be assembled entirely through abstract interfaces that do not
  expose either the storage of objects in the analysis model or the
  computational details of the time integration method. Sequence diagrams
  document the interoperability of the analysis classes for solving nonlinear
  finite-element equations, demonstrating that object composition with design
  patterns provides a general approach to developing and refactoring nonlinear
  finite-element software. {\textcopyright} 2010 ASCE.%

    Corrosion of reinforcement is one of the leading causes of the
  deterioration in reinforced concrete structures. RC structures damaged by
  reinforcement corrosion can exhibit not only reduction of the bearing
  capacity but also an alteration of the collapse mechanism with a reduction of
  the structural ductility. In order to study the problem, full scale
  experimental tests on column specimens have been performed under cyclic
  loads. Preliminary tests for the calibration of the corrosion process have
  been carried out both on bare and embedded bars. The results of the cyclic
  experimental tests show how the reinforce ment corrosion can lead to a
  reduction of the structural ductility, such that it could become a critical
  aspect particularly for buildings in seismic regions%

    A reasonable understanding of the cyclic behavior of reinforcing steel is
  required to accurately estimate the performance of reinforced concrete
  members subjected to cyclic deformations beyond the elastic range such as
  those expected from large earthquakes. Although the cyclic behavior of
  reinforcing steel has been extensively studied, very little is known about
  the effects that factors such as the bar deformations, strain rate, and
  strain aging have on the cyclic behavior. The effects of strain aging on the
  cyclic behavior of reinforcing steel can be very relevant when considering
  postearthquake retrofitting of reinforced concrete structures. A series of
  cyclic uniaxial tests were conducted at the University of Canterbury on the
  two commercially available grades of New Zealand reinforcing steel, where the
  effects of cyclic loading, bar deformations, strain rate, and strain aging on
  the stress-strain behavior of reinforcing steel were investigated. The
  emphasis of the tests was to observe the material behavior, and hence
  buckling was restricted. The present paper describes the test setup and
  discusses the results of the investigation.%

    A new plastic hinge integration method overcomes the problems with
  nonobjective response caused by strain-softening behavior in force-based
  beam-column finite elements. The integration method uses the common concept
  of a plastic hinge length in a numerically consistent manner. The method,
  derived from the Gauss-Radau quadrature rule, integrates deformations over
  specified plastic hinge lengths at the ends of the beam-column element, and
  it has the desirable property that it reduces to the exact solution for
  linear problems. Numerical examples show the effect of plastic hinge
  integration on the response of force-based beam-column elements for both
  strain-hardening and strain-softening section behavior in the plastic hinge
  regions. The incorporation of a plastic hinge length in the element
  integration method ensures objective element and section response, which is
  important for strain-softening behavior in reinforced concrete structures.
  Plastic rotations are defined in a consistent manner and clearly related to
  deformations in the plastic hinges.%

    A structural deterioration reliability (probabilistic) model has been used
  herein to calculate probabilities of structural failure. New reinforced
  concrete corrosion initiation, corrosion rate and time-variant load models
  are proposed. Three durability design specifications are considered in a
  lifetime reliability analysis of a RC slab bridge. Time-variant increases in
  loads are considered also. It was found that the application of de-icing
  salts causes significant long-term deterioration and reduction in structural
  safety for poor durability design specifications. A reduced cover or
  increased water-cement ratio increases failure probabilities. When compared
  to the case of “no deterioration”, it was observed also that the
  probability of failure only marginally increased for good durability design
  specifications. The approaches described herein are relevant to other
  physical infrastructure also.%

    The reinforced concrete (RC) columns infiltrated by chloride ion in marine
  environment are much vulner- able under seismic loading. In this paper, the
  hysteretic behaviors of corroded RC columns were studied, which were
  considered as the condition of tide region or splash zone. Experiments were
  designed for five groups of corroded RC columns with different maximum
  amounts of corrosion of rebar under cyclic lat- eral loads combined with a
  constant vertical load. The traditional soaking method was replaced by a new
  wrapping method in order to obtain the desired amount of corrosion of rebar
  that was similar with the environment condition. The results showed that the
  flexural strength, the circular stiffness, the ductility, and the energy
  absorption of corroded RC column degraded with the increase of the maximum
  amount of corrosion of rebar. The maximum amount of corrosion of 13.25{\%}
  and the dilation crack width of 1.2 mm were two important critical
  parameters.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    Corrosion damage is one of the main problems affecting the durability of
  concrete structures. Several corroded reinforced concrete (RC) railway
  bridges are located in regions of high seismic risk. Corroded bridge piers
  are often subjected to dynamic axial loads, such as the vertical pounding
  that occurs during earthquakes or due to railway trains. Repeated axial
  loading was used to simulate this vertical pounding effect. Therefore, the
  seismic performance of corroded RC structures under repeated axial and
  horizontal cyclic loading is an urgent issue. To investigate the influences
  of steel corrosion and repeated axial loading on the seismic performance of a
  column pier, eight RC column speci-mens were experimentally investigated. The
  results indicated that corrosion significantly influences the yield strength
  and load bearing capacity of a column. The load bearing capacities of the
  corroded specimens decreased by 18.27{\%} compared with noncorroded specimens
  when the longitudinal loss of steel mass was 7.16{\%}. Repeated axial loading
  did not significantly influence the mechanical properties of the cor-roded RC
  piers. Cyclic tests were performed to validate a finite-element model that
  was used to assess the effects of corrosion level on the seis-mic performance
  of columns. The level of steel corrosion ranged from 0 to 28{\%}. According
  to the finite-element analysis, the yield strength (35{\%}) and ultimate
  displacement (34{\%}) decreased with increasing corrosion.%

    In flexural concrete members, strain penetration occurs along longitudinal
  reinforcing bars that are fully anchored into connecting concrete members,
  causing bar slips along a partial anchoring length and thus end rotations to
  the flexural members at the connection intersections. Ignoring the strain
  penetration in linear and nonlinear analyses. of concrete structures will
  underestimate the deflections and member elongation, and overestimate the
  stiffness, hysteretic energy dissipation capacities, strains, and section
  curvature. Focusing on the member end rotation due to strain penetration
  along reinforcing bars fully anchored in footings and bridge joints, this
  paper introduces a hysteretic model for the reinforcing bar stress versus
  slip response that can be integrated into fiber-based analysis of concrete
  structures using a zero-length section element. The ability of the proposed
  hysteretic model to capture the strain penetration effects is demonstrated by
  simulating the measured global and local responses of two concrete columns
  and a bridge T-joint system. Unless the strain penetration effects are
  satisfactorily modeled, it is shown that the analysis of concrete structures
  will appreciably underestimate the local response parameters that are used to
  quantify structural damage.%

    \field{abstract}{%
    OpenSees, an open source finite element software framework, has been used
  broadly in the earthquake engineering community for simulating the seismic
  response of structural and geotechnical systems. The framework allows users
  to perform finite element analysis with a scripting language and for
  developers to create both serial and parallel finite element computer
  applications as interpreters. For the last 15 years, Tcl has been the primary
  scripting language to which the model building and analysis modules of
  OpenSees are linked. To provide users with different scripting language
  options, particularly Python, the OpenSees interpreter interface was
  refactored to provide multi-interpreter capabilities. This refactoring,
  resulting in the creation of OpenSeesPy as a Python module, is accomplished
  through an abstract interface for interpreter calls with concrete
  implementations for different scripting languages. Through this approach,
  users are able to develop applications that utilize the unique features of
  several scripting languages while taking advantage of advanced finite element
  analysis models and algorithms.%
